                    COVID-19 has put a spotlight on racial disparities and
                    social injustices that plague the United States. Black,
                    Latinx, Asians and other people of color (POC) have been
                    disproportionately affected by the disease. They are the
                    frontline workers who work every day for non-livable wages,
                    little or no sick pay and minimal access to healthcare.

                    Systemic racism has left POC behind to work blue collar jobs
                    to feed, clothe and serve a privileged white America.
                    Non-white is almost synonymous with non-citizen as POC have
                    historically been deprived of human rights and marginalized
                    based on their race. The culminating piece of the Stories of
                    San Diego Project is a book that will bring together the
                    work of journalists from San Diego and beyond to explore and
                    record this historic time as it unfolds.
